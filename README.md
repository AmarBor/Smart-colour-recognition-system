# Smart-colour-recognition-system

I have developing a smart color recognition system that aims to assist individuals with visual impairments in identifying colors with Arduino.
The system is designed to be effective in teaching and helping people with vision disabilities to recognize colors. 
I have created two versions of the system, one with an application and another that utilizes an MP3 serial player.
